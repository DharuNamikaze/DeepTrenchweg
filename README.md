# Deep-ML-Trench - Machine Learning Under the Iceberg.

Exploration of machine learning concepts organized by depth and complexity. we present ML topics from basic fundamentals to state-of-the-art research in an ocean-depth metaphor.

## What is this?

Deep-ML-Trench is a information site that displays machine learning concepts arranged by their complexity level, from surface-level fundamentals (0-2000m) down to deep theoretical research (14000m+). Each concept includes a brief description and links to learn more.

The site covers topics like:
- **Base Level**: Regression, clustering, neural networks
- **Deep Levels**: Transformers, attention mechanisms, scaling laws
- **The Void**: Advanced theory, topological deep learning, frontier research

## How to Run

1. **Install Node.js** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. **Open terminal/command prompt** and navigate to the project folder

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
